<h2>Description</h2>

    <li>5 tablespoons butter</li>
    <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 quart milk</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt </li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg</li>
</ul>
<h2> Directions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add flour and whisk into the melted butter until smooth. Cook and stir until flour turns a light, golden, sandy color, about 7 minutes.</li>
    <li>Increase heat to medium-high and slowly whisk in milk until thickened by the roux. Bring to a gentle simmer, then reduce heat to medium-low and continue simmering until the flour has softened and no longer tastes gritty, 10 to 20 minutes. Season with salt and nutmeg.</li>
